You would need to replace {subscriptionId}, {resourceGroupName}, and {hostingPlanName} with your own details. The ARM template does not automatically replace these values.

After creating the JSON file, you can use the Azure CLI to deploy the template:

This command deploys the ARM template in the file template.json to the resource group myResourceGroup. It sets the function app name and storage account name to myFunctionApp and myStorageAccount, respectively.

Please note that this is a basic example and you may need to adjust the template to fit your needs. For instance, if you are using a language runtime other than .NET, you would need to adjust the FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME setting.
